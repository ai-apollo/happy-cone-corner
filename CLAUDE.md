# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Japanese ice cream shop website ("アイスクリーム天国" - Ice Cream Paradise) built as a Lovable project. It's a single-page application with sections for home, menu, about, and contact.

**Tech Stack:**
- Vite + React 18 + TypeScript
- shadcn/ui components (Radix UI primitives)
- Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- React Router for routing
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- React Hook Form + Zod for forms

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Start dev server (runs on http://localhost:8080)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Build for development mode
npm run build:dev

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Code Architecture

### Project Structure

- `src/pages/` - Route pages (Index.tsx is the main landing page, NotFound.tsx for 404s)
- `src/components/` - Custom application components (Navbar, HeroSection, MenuSection, AboutSection, ContactSection, Footer)
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui component library (reusable UI primitives)
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/lib/` - Utility functions (utils.ts contains the `cn()` helper for class merging)

### Application Entry Points

1. `main.tsx` - React app entry point
2. `App.tsx` - Root component with providers:
   - QueryClientProvider (TanStack Query)
   - TooltipProvider (Radix UI)
   - BrowserRouter (React Router)
   - Toaster components (shadcn/ui + Sonner)

### Routing

Routes are defined in `App.tsx`:
- `/` - Main landing page (Index component)
- `*` - 404 page (NotFound component)

**Important:** All custom routes must be added ABOVE the catch-all `*` route in App.tsx.

### Component Architecture

The main page (`pages/Index.tsx`) is composed of section components that are stacked vertically:
- Navbar (fixed header with scroll behavior)
- HeroSection
- MenuSection
- AboutSection
- ContactSection
- Footer

Each section is a standalone component in `src/components/`.

### Styling System

**Path Alias:** `@` maps to `./src` (configured in vite.config.ts and tsconfig.json)

**Custom Theme Colors:**
- `cream-*` - Warm cream/beige palette (50-950 shades)
- `chocolate-*` - Brown/chocolate palette (50-950 shades)
- Standard shadcn theme colors (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)

**Custom Fonts:**
- Sans: 'Noto Sans JP' (Japanese sans-serif)
- Serif: 'Noto Serif JP' (Japanese serif)

**Custom Animations:**
- `animate-float` - Gentle vertical floating effect
- `animate-scale` - Subtle scaling effect

**Utility Function:**
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` to merge Tailwind classes with proper precedence

### TypeScript Configuration

**Relaxed Type Checking:** This project has TypeScript strict mode disabled:
- `noImplicitAny: false`
- `strictNullChecks: false`
- `noUnusedParameters: false`
- `noUnusedLocals: false`
- `allowJs: true`

When adding types, follow the existing lenient style rather than enforcing strict typing.

### shadcn/ui Components

The `src/components/ui/` directory contains pre-built shadcn components. These are:
- Self-contained and can be modified directly
- Built on Radix UI primitives
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Imported with the `@/components/ui/*` alias

To use a component: Import from `@/components/ui/[component-name]`

## Lovable Integration

This project was generated by Lovable and includes:
- `lovable-tagger` plugin (runs in development mode only)
- Automatic commits when changes are made via the Lovable platform
- Project URL: https://lovable.dev/projects/40082d31-17e4-4cf0-bcc3-04eac4f48a6f

Changes made locally can be pushed and will sync with Lovable.
